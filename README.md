# Huffman File Compression and Decompression using C++

This is a file compression and decompression program using Huffman coding in c++.

## Description

This project is based on Huffman Coding algorithm, it basically 
assigns a binary code to each character occuring in the input file
 in such a way that the most frequent element will get the minimum code 
 length and the least frequent element will get the maximum length.
 And this is how the actual weighted size of the character reduces by using the 
 huffman code which overall reduces the file size by 40-50%.
